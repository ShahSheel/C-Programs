# C-Programs

These programs listed here are programs I have created during my Foundation year at <a href = "Http://www.sussex.ac.uk"> University Of Sussex </a>.

## Painter.C

This was my very first time programming.  The program then asks questions, how much does it cost for labour? Does the client want a undercoat? What type of paint - glossy, matt , silk ? 
It involves around conditional statements and mathemical equations to calculate how much paint is needed to paint a room.

## Table-Tennis.C

This program involes on "How to use 2D arrays" , the user enters 16 names . It will clear the screen and then player 1 will verse player 2 , player 3 will verse player 4 and so on and forth. The winners advance to the semi-finals then quater finals and then the finals where the winner is declared. 

If you do not know what the layout of a 2D array look below to see an example!. 

For example:

pins = {{0,1,2,}}, {3,4,5}, {6,7,8}}

This will be layed out as: 

0 1 2
3 4 5           
6 7 8       

Going accross is columns and going down are rows.

We can say:

pins[0][2] a = ints[0] . <-- A is referenced to 0 1 2 as the row is 0 and no column is identified!


## Database.C

This program involves Structs and 1D arrays. The user inputs information such as their height, weight and sex. This information is then stored into a struct then gets called by a method which saves it to a file.
